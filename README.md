# ReptonMapDecoder
I wrote this application to take a screen shot of a map from PC Repton 1 or 2 and produce a bitmap or CSV file of the map for my Repton Resource Page website.
It works for me, but might not for you. The screen shots need to be of a specific size, and anti-aliasing caused by GIF, PNG or JPEG artifacts can affect the results wildly.
I will be converting this project to a Lazarus one, but first I need to remove the extra custom components required - such as the commericially available TAdvancePanels and the no-longer supported TLZRW1.
