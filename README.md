# Repton Map Decoder
I wrote this application to take a screen shot of a map from PC Repton 1 or 2 and produce a bitmap or CSV file of the map for my Repton Resource Page website.<br>
It works for me, but might not for you. The screen shots need to be of a specific size, and anti-aliasing caused by GIF, PNG or JPEG artifacts can affect the results wildly.
